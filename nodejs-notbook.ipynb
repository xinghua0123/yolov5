    "## Nodebooks: Introducing Node.js Data Science Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are where data scientists process, analyse, and visualise data in an iterative, collaborative environment. They typically run environments for languages like Python, R, and Scala. For years, data science notebooks have served academics and research scientists as a scratchpad for writing code, refining algorithms, and sharing and proving their work. Today, it's a workflow that lends itself well to web developers experimenting with data sets in Node.js.\n",
    "\n",
    "To that end, pixiedust_node is an add-on for Jupyter notebooks that allows Node.js/JavaScript to run inside notebook cells. Not only can web developers use the same workflow for collaborating in Node.js, but they can also use the same tools to work with existing data scientists coding in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "pixiedust_node is built on the popular PixieDust helper library. Let’s get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: Run one cell at a time or unexpected results might be observed.\n",
